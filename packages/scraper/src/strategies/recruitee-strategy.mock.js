          '<p>The world is undergoing a radical transformation. Work, commerce and even education is moving online. Hotjar is at the core of that transformation. </p>\n' +
          '<p><br /></p>\n' +
          '<p>Hotjar wants to make the web a better place. We believe many digital experiences - whether they are on desktop or mobile - quite frankly suck, and we are working to change that. </p>\n' +
          '<p><br /></p>\n' +
          '<p>We’re building easy and intuitive behaviour analytics software for businesses selling online.
